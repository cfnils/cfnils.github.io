Two Shoe Salesmen

Two Shoe Salesmen
There is a tale about two shoe salesmen who travel to a developing country in search of new business
opportunities.
One man calls his wife the moment he lands, telling her, “Honey, I’m coming back home. There’s no hope
here. Nobody here is wearing shoes, so there’s no one to sell to.” He boards the next flight home.
The second man calls his wife and says, “Honey, you wouldn’t believe what I found here. There is so much
opportunity. No one here is wearing shoes. I can sell to the whole country!”
There’s opportunity everywhere. When we have a consciousness of expecting the magic to happen, it will
happen. We’ll find the right people, we’ll move in the right circles, we’ll ‘bump’ into the right solutions. It all
starts with that opening in the mind.

Situation
You just finished working for the 17th straight day. You have averaged 12-hour days during the week and
eight hours per day on weekends. Your clients are demanding quick service and there seems to be no end
in sight. You have eleven more projects to complete within the month. You remember your child's name but
didn't realize they had pierced their nose. Your spouse told you last night that the kid had done it three weeks
ago.
Despite being challenged for time and sanity you still have to attend the annual Chamber of Commerce dinner
because you are President. You walk in the door of the dinner meeting and
the first person that greets you says “Hey Pat, I haven't seen you in a while, how's business?”

2) Satisfied customers are my best referral source. I just have to tell them I want new business and ask for
referrals

3) Good is the enemy of great

4) We not I

5) I  love ____________ (Tell your prospects what you love most about what you do, it creates enthusiasm,
confidence and curiosity)

6) The critical few. The trivial many. It's all about results.

Think about your activities. Are you getting bogged down by trivial tasks and issues that don't really affect the
success of your business? You should be focusing on the few critical priorities that drive results.

Dear Community Vendor First Name:
As you know, I have been a customer of yours for some time now. Actually, I would describe myself as a satisfied customer who has
been more than happy. I know in my business, satisfied customers are our most important asset, and hopefully you feel the same way.
As one of your satisfied customers who has helped your business increase your success in the past, I would like to show you how our
business can increase your profit even more.
I know that sounds aggressive, but the reality of our service is that we cannot possibly decrease your bottom line. In other words, there
is no cost for our professional service.
All we do is examine all of your essential business services, such as telecommunications, merchant services, small package shipping
and courier, waste, electronic logging devices, eSignature, fuel, facility supplies, less than truckload, software as a service, uniforms
and linens, unified communications as a service, compressed gases. We make sure you are being billed correctly, and you have the best
prices and services available to you. If we are unable to find ways to increase your profit, then we don’t charge any fees!
First of all, you would be surprised how often there are overcharges in these invoices. We recover that money for you!
Secondly, with all of the changes to these industries on a daily basis, it is impossible to keep up with all of your options. That’s what
we do for you – and our only fee is to share in the savings we identify for you for a limited period of time. The rest goes directly to
your bottom line – forever!
The result is that we review your service invoices and contracts, and we bring you recommendations to increase your bottom line. If
we can’t find anything for you, then there is no fee. That means that it’s a risk-free service with the only possibility being to find you
extra money for your bank account, or we simply confirm that you have everything the way it should be at no cost.
Either way, you win!
One other important point to make is that we don’t sell you anything. We are completely independent of any vendor of these services,
so we are only looking for the best options for you, based on what you need.
Just as I have been a customer of yours, I would like to show you how you will benefit by being a customer of mine!

Yours truly,

To Whom It May Concern,
I recently met with a colleague at Earl’s restaurant for a business lunch and my experience could not have been
better.
Earl’s is the fastest growing Casual Dining restaurant chain in the city. They feature a varied fare to appeal to all
tastes with very reasonable pricing. Each restaurant boasts a certified chef to ensure quality standards are met
for each dining experience. They really focus on special care for their clientele.
From the minute I walked in the door I was treated with respect and professionalism. I was greeted with an
earnest smile and a happy greeting. They really did make me feel that they were pleased that I had chosen their
restaurant for my business lunch.
At Schooley Mitchell we focus on getting to know our clients and colleagues so business lunches are frequent.
My experience at Earl’s stood out.
The service was great and the food was great as well. The atmosphere was conducive to a good, professional
conversation with my guest. While I know it was just lunch they made me feel welcome and satisfied to the
degree that I felt compelled to write this letter of recommendation.
I really would recommend Earl’s to any business person wishing to entertain clients and build solid relationships.
Yours truly,
Jane Smith

An example of a note you can send to the owner of the business that you are sending the testimonial to on an
unsolicited basis. Explain the values they receive because of this letter.

Dear Peter:
The last time I was at your restaurant, I had a very pleasant experience. Actually, it has always been a pleasant
experience every time I visit for my business lunches and meetings.
As a result, I thought I would write a letter of recommendation for you. I don’t know if you will find it useful
but I hope you do.
I have mailed you a hard copy so you have that to use as you wish but I am also sending you an electronic
version to use as well. When my customers recommend me I find it useful to post the note on my website and
social media sites, and also to send to people from time to time.
I will also post it to my website at www.schooleymitchell.com/smith with a link back to your website for you.
Hopefully that will create a little extra traffic for you, and if nothing else that link back to your site will create
some search engine optimization value for you.
I really appreciate your commitment to run a great business and I just wanted to show you that sometimes
people take note of a job well done.

To Whom It May Concern:
When I go to a convenience store to pick up a few supplies I don’t really expect too much. However, whenever
I visit Quick Stop at Front and Lake I always feel as if I have been treated well.
Quick Stop is a chain but each store is customized for the neighborhood where they operate. They stock thousands of commonly needed items so their customers can meet their needs without having to deal with the big
grocery stores. Lots of parking and friendly service is their motto.
I would say they meet that standard every time I visit. Whether it’s Jenny Chan, or one of her well trained employees that serves me, it’s always friendly and efficient. I don’t think I have ever visited the shop when they
didn’t have what I needed.
I appreciate the hard work that Jenny puts into her small businesses and I would recommend her Quick Stop
store to everyone within driving distance.

Hi, this is Dennis Schooley from Schooley Mitchell calling.
I’m an Optimization Specialist for the [auto] industry. I help companies cut your business costs in several
areas, including telecom, merchant services, small package shipping and courier, waste, electronic logging
devices, eSignature, fuel, facility supplies, less than truckload, software as a service, uniforms and linens,
unified communications as a service, compressed gases, all from an independent standpoint. I’m not sure if I
can help you or not, which is why I’m calling.
We’ve helped other companies like yours and I’d love to be able to come in to show you what we’ve done for
them. It will help me determine if we’re able to do the same for you.
I’d like to set up a short briefing, it should take 20 to 30 minutes. Do you have something open on your

“You know how business people pay too much for their telecom, merchant services and small package
shipping and don’t know if they’re paying the right amounts? That’s what we do – we help make sure they’re
not paying more than they should be paying to their vendors.”
“By describing a common problem first, it helps the potential client perceive a need and then they see you as
the potential solution.” (Jeff Mowat)

Elevator Speech Sample – Core Service

Elevator Speech Sample – Core Service
Our core service is pretty simple. We review everything you do for our expense categories with a view to save
you time and money.
Our audit includes your merchant services costs, courier costs, waste costs, wireless, local service,
conferencing, internet access and data systems, – and anything else you may use.
We do three basic things.
Firstly, we make sure that you are being billed correctly, and you would be shocked how often we find
mistakes. Then we would get your money back for you and put it back in your bank account.
Secondly, we will check your services for you to see if you are paying for things you don't either need or want.
Thirdly, and more important than the other two we examine the whole marketplace using our specialized
processes and tools to identify the best prices possible while maintaining the same level of service for you.
Two really great things about our service:
1) O
  ne, our Fees are self-funded from the savings; if we don't find savings for you, there is no fee at all - just a
free audit.
2) T
  wo, we are completely independent of all vendors - we only look out for your best interests. We don’t have
a horse in the race.

Fee Based Job
There are a number of reasons we can help you:
The suppliers know that we are familiar with the market so they tend to keep their pencils sharp – we probably
recover a good portion of our fee for you through reduced pricing.
You can concentrate on your business, while we spend our time dealing with vendors, technology options,
and comparing quotes. We spend our time making sure we're comparing apples to apples for you.
Through our knowledge and experience, we help you get the right thing, at the right price, from the right

Introduction to The Pulse

Dear (Recipient First Name):
One of the great programs we have at Schooley Mitchell is called ‘The Pulse’, also known as The Schooley
Mitchell Business Education Network.
We provide this program free of charge to all of our business contacts, and to all of our clients. It’s just an added
value we provide to the people we have come to know.
The program is both educational and enjoyable. We will send an email to you every couple of weeks containing
one of the following items:
1) A short video or audio of a prominent business speaker that we have engaged
(informative and enjoyable)
2) A book review of a recent business book (we know you’re often too busy to read the whole book and yet the
information can be so valuable to help keep you up to date with current practices and ideas)
3) A brief article about a pertinent business topic of the day
I have arranged to have ‘The Pulse’ delivered directly to you. Of course, you can opt out at any time, but I
think you’ll find it very valuable if you give it a try a couple of times. If the item delivered has business value
for you then you will benefit on an ongoing basis but if a particular item doesn’t interest you then you can
simply delete it.
This program is just our way of helping you with your everyday business strategies
and challenges. Enjoy!
Yours truly,

(Your name)

The Pulse Library

The Pulse Library – Send to Contacts
The Warehouse will now have a section called “Pulse Issues‟. This area archives all issues of The Pulse that
have been sent out in the past. Each new Pulse issue will be archived in this area after it is sent out.
If you have a client, contact, or referral source that might have an interest in any of the topics that are in the
inventory, you can now send them any of the Pulse issues along with your custom comments.
As you know, putting a contact on The Pulse program will ensure they get the sample note, as well as all
future Pulse issues from that point forward. However, that also means that new people won't get the issues
that have already been sent. That's why we're making them available to you to use as additional electronic
marketing collateral with some “oomph‟.
This is a custom method of providing Distinctive Value to contacts based on their interests, and your individual efforts. You can complement the current issues of the Pulse with any of these
issues that you feel are appropriate for any of your contacts or clients.
Note 1: The default introductory Pulse that every new entry into the system receives contains the Ted Ed
video How to Practice Effectively for Just About Anything, the Motivation Management article, and the book
review for Daniel Pink’s To Sell is Human. You may not want to send those particular issues because they will
get them if you enroll the contact in the program. You can also customize the introductory Pulse issue with
videos of your choice if you prefer.
Note 2: Sending the Pulse inventory issues will not automatically enroll the recipient in the
program itself, so be sure you do that as well.
Note 3: You can test the system to see what it looks like by enrolling as a recipient on the easy to use form in
The Warehouse.

Drip Marketing Campaigns

Drip Marketing Campaigns
The purposes of a drip marketing campaign:
a) Stay in touch with many people simultaneously
b) Stay in touch regularly with any one person – each touch is a rose
c) Provide valuable information to others (DV) – be a giver
d) Use technology to enhance your practices
e) Be progressive
We have put together a number of campaigns with content for you. For example:
a)  Let’s say you want a drip campaign to promote your own services at Schooley Mitchell that you can
use with prospective clients and referral sources etc.
b)  Let’s say you want to give people advice about using social media in their business
c)  Let’s say you want to send simple sales tips to people in order to help them in their businesses
d)  Let’s say you want to stay in touch with prospects who have gone cold by sending Good News stories
e)  Let’s say you want to leverage large client case studies with prospects or other contacts so they see
the value we deliver
• Selling Schooley Mitchell Services – these items are complementary to your selling efforts, they are not your
selling focus. You will not get a boatload of clients just because you send out emails, each one is a deposit
into the relationship bank account.
• You can add or subtract to the campaign as you see fit to send to your audience(s)

Hi Frank:
I was doing some research on the web yesterday for one of my clients who was originally referred to me by one of
my happy clients. I came across this article that I thought would interest you. I copied the link below for you.
I don’t know if you have already seen it or not but it seems to be relevant to your business so I thought I should
send it to you in case you find it useful.
I hope it has some value for you.

Business Distinctive Value
To All Consultants:
There was a question on the Prospecting webinar yesterday related to Business Distinctive Value. The
Warehouse CRM system has a spot to record Personal DV as well as Business DV.
Personal DV would include things like personal interests, hobbies, sports, etc. Business DV would
include things like business stresses, issues, problems, and concerns, as well as interests and
opportunities.
The point of recording these types of things is that they are fully searchable. As a result, if you come
across a good article about golf, you can call up all your contacts that have golf as an interest and
send them the information.
An example of business DV, might be if you came across an article, book, website, video, or other
resource or referral that related to any subject you have recorded in the database such as – staff
retention, employee motivation, office politics, interested in international markets, distribution
problems, etc. As you can see, there can be all kinds of subjects, stresses, and interests recorded here
so you can address them or provide related information as you are able to do so.
This type of information can be gold to you. The CRM system is the spot to record the information so
it can be queried at any time in the future for you to take action. Those interests and issues will always
be recorded in your contact’s record, and can also be queried by subject or keyword etc.

Distinctive Value
DV Program

To All Consultants:
Re: Distinctive Value Program
One of the Distinctive Value items we suggest to send to contacts, prospects, and clients is an article
of interest that may have an effect on their business or industry. As long as it is something current
that may provide value to them, or pertinent knowledge to them, it will in turn provide value to you by
sending it. The value will be in relationship capital.
We are providing an article to you that may be interesting to some of your contacts, prospects, and
clients so you can send it to them. You simply have to decide which ones will receive benefit if you
send it to them.
In some cases it may be appropriate to send them the link included below via email. In most cases it
will be more effective to clip or print the article itself and send it with a hand written note. Don’t be lazy
with this – clip it, send a short note, and use the snail mail to really make a mark.
Each time you do this it will ensure that the recipient knows that you are thinking about them and
going out of your way to provide value to them. It doesn’t matter if they’ve already seen the item you
are sending. It’s still a touch from you – it’s a rose.
We are instituting a program whereby we will provide these articles of interest for certain industry
segments on a periodic basis. You choose how many people it will apply to and use it accordingly.
You should not do this too often with any one person so it becomes bothersome. However, you can
judge to whom you should send each article, and also to how many of your contacts, prospects, and
clients.
Article for the Week: The Internet of Medicine Is Just What The Doctor Ordered
Technology, driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), is poised to make a big change to the healthcare
industry. The IoT holds the key to lowering medical costs, improving quality and making healthcare
more personalized, accessible and affordable for average patients. The Internet of Medicine (IoM) will
increasingly rely on recurring revenue arrangements, and its impact could soon exceed a trillion dollars
per year.

1) Ask if they will refer to you:
• North-South-East-West
• Vendors
• Customers
• Associations
2) Ask for a testimonial letter upon the completion of every assignment (Warehouse)
•  It's preferable if your client writes it, but if they are too busy there is nothing wrong with offering to
write it for them so they can approve it and copy it onto their letterhead for signature. Call them to
offer to write it if they don't respond within a reasonable time.
•  Don’t give up on this – it’s one of our most valuable weapons! Go back and ask again if you’re not
successful the first time.
3) Ask if you can use them as a reference for others to call
4) Ask if they are interested in a paid referral relationship – share the wealth
5) Ask if they will introduce you to others, preferably by bringing their contact to coffee or lunch with you.
If they aren't able to do that, a telephone or email introduction would be the next best steps.

SMARRT Introduction

SMARRT Introduction
Please do not explain the program to your client ahead of time. You are just asking for a negative reaction if
you do that.
Think about when you received a gift from someone that was unexpected and how good it made you feel.
That's much, much better than saying, “Hey, I'm going to give you something tomorrow.”
If you try to explain what the program is all about you are missing a significant part of the value. Expectations
get out of whack and misunderstanding takes place. By simply continuing to deliver the individual values in
the program unexpectedly your likability increases much more. If you explain that we will be doing this, or
doing that, each month in the future you will get people that will say, “Don't bother.” Lost opportunity.
Just let it happen and don't over think it. Just do it as outlined in The Warehouse. The feedback we continue
to receive is nothing short of fantastic so please just trust the process and don't even mention it to the
recipient.

Not every client will be a natural fit for each step of the SMARRT Relationship Builder. Consider substituting
steps with the following:
• Send your client a Distinctive Value article.
•  Put your client on the Pulse and send them a note to let them know they can share the content with
their own contacts, use in newsletters, etc.
•  Ask your client if they would like to put on a webinar/seminar to pass on their special knowledge and
skills to your other clients.
• Send an email to another client/contact promoting your client's products or services.
• Write a recommendation for them on LinkedIn.

Use Google Alerts to keep tabs on your client:
•  Set up alerts for their name and their business name, and any new content indexed online or any
mentions in the news will be delivered to your inbox.
•  Use that information in your relationship building strategies. For example, if they win a big award and
are featured in the newspaper, you will receive an alert. You can then promo that accomplishment
online, or reach out to them to offer congratulations with a handwritten card.

IT/Computer Company

To All Consultants:
I was preparing the weekly sales tip for The Warehouse and I realized that this one is so important that it should also
be sent via group email.
List every client you have and...
Ask your client for the name of their outsourced IT/Computer company. These types of companies have all kinds of
business clients and are often quite motivated to increase their revenues through paid referrals to their clients. You
may need to prove yourself but this can be a very lucrative source to multiple clients for you if they “get it”.
This is especially easy to get introductions to this type of vendor if you have been promoting your client via the
SMARRT Program but even if not...
You may even want to consider a higher than normal referral fee because if done properly they can walk you right
in to their existing clients. You may also want to explain to the IT company that they can tell their clients that our
savings may be able to fund purchases of the goods and services the client needs (and they would like to sell).
List every client of yours and make it a mission – find out every IT provider for every client. Then take them out to
lunch one-by-one. They should be happy to do so under the premise “maybe we can help each other – I’m not sure but
I would be willing to spring for lunch to find out.”
If a company has internal IT staff, they very likely still have a local IT or computer vendor as well so don't give up
until you research properly. Just imagine if you get even half of them to bite. We have five or six companies like this
to service little old Stratford so imagine how many there are within 30 minutes of your house.

Tell & Ask
Referral Strategy

Paid Referral Sources
I have had several people ask what I say when I’m setting up a paid referral relationship. I think that sometimes we simply ask someone if they would like to make some money by referring business to us
and then slap them on the back, go home and pray they will send business our way.
I would be very surprised if that method works at all. Even if they agree to do so, I would doubt
they will act.
First of all, the approach should be much more of a professional nature. We want them to understand that this isn’t an
"on the side, under the table" thing because that has the wrong feel. We want them to understand they are helping us
grow our professional business and that they can share some significant benefit from helping us do so. It should go
something like this;
“Many businesses make the mistake of assuming that other people know they are trying to grow their business. I don’t
want to make that mistake because I am certainly looking for new clients to improve my business. In fact, if you could
give me some advice and would like to help me grow I would be very thankful. In fact, I’d even be willing to share the
wealth if you are interested in helping me. As you know, I only make money if I save my clients money, so I would be
more than happy to share those savings with you for anyone you refer to me.”
If they agree to that premise, that’s when you have to make the direct "ask". You should be prepared before you begin
this conversation with some idea of who they may know. Once they say, "yeah, I might be interested", that’s when you
say, “Great, would you be willing to give me some advice?” (They always say yes) “You know I would really like to see if I
can help that business next door to yours. Do you know the financial person there?”
Obviously, you may ask for some other example as opposed to a neighbouring business but the point is to be prepared
to ask for a referral right there if appropriate. It takes a little research – so do it beforehand. Asking them if they would
provide you with advice also makes them feel important and ultimately, more cooperative.
In addition to this method of providing the message, and asking for a specific referral, you need to nurture the relationship. It won’t continue to happen if you don’t build on the relationship. You will get much more benefit if you speak with
the person on a regular basis:
1) Meet with them for coffee
2) E
  xplain clearly what you are looking for and communicate that to them every time you add to the list of potential targets
3) Take them to lunch
4) Continue to ask them if they can provide you with advice
5) Deliver their check/cheque to them once in a while
6) P
  ay them as often as you possibly can. Send a check/cheque every time you get one from a client – don’t accumulate
them – it’s not about efficiency or saving a stamp – it’s about reinforcing the activity
7) I MPORTANT – STORIES WORK – tell them stories of successes – not just yours but all of SM. Tell them that we had
one Consultant that paid $20,000 to one referral source last year and $40,000 to another. Tell them we had one Consultant that paid out more than $50,000 last year to various referral sources.
8) Give them gifts
Remember this – find reasons this entire process will work as opposed to reasons it won’t!!

Great News Memo

To All Franchisees,
Great, Great News – Paid Referral That Is Exponential!
This one is worthy of its own Great News Memo!
Recently in one of our Good News Memos, there was a story about a lucrative paid referral relationship set up by
Treigh Hubbard and an Optometrist Association. He pays them 10% of his earnings from members and they have
pledged to refer over 300 members. Now it’s really paying off!
Treigh has signed 50 of these clients already – four in just this past two weeks with his subcontractors with more
briefings set up in the near future.
He presented the first client with savings of $44,000. The client was extremely happy and signed off on the spot.
Treigh asked for referrals and the Doctor walked him into a law firm three doors away.
Treigh walked out with the signed Service Agreement and LOAs! Now that’s using the Shining Star Method we
teach!
And that’s not all…
To make his day even greater that same Doctor referred him to a Chiropractor who is an executive of the Chiropractic
Association. After reviewing our services with Treigh, the Chiropractor explained they are having their Association
meeting in Cancun this weekend – and made arrangement to fly Treigh to Cancun to present to the whole group at
their conference for three days!!
Wow! Wow! Wow!

Specific Ask - Email to Paid Referral Source

Hi Bob.
I had someone ask me just the other day about the type of prospect that would make a perfect referral for me. It made
me realize that one of your vendors would actually be a great referral for me. Do you know anyone at Paper Products
Inc.?
If you are OK with making that referral to me, I would be more than happy to follow up. I’m pretty sure we will be
able to increase their profits with no risk to them.
I have a client in a similar business where we saved them in excess of $35,000. Of course, that would mean $1,750 for
you for referring me to help them cut costs.
Please let me know if you would be able to introduce me to someone of responsibility at Paper Products Inc. Let’s talk
about the best method of introduction to increase our chance of success as well. I will give you a call to set up a coffee
or lunch meeting to discuss.
Thanks Bob – much appreciated.

Individual Meetings/Lunches with Paid Referral sources

Schedule 1-2-1 Lunches with every paid referral source at least twice per year
If you do this right it can be the source of many referrals for you
Stalk them before the meeting (Know Your Source)
Buy them lunch – even if it’s virtual – send them lunch with a food delivery service and break bread with them
virtually – a bit of fun makes for good connections.
Prepare for the meeting – and tell them you want to take some notes as you go along so you don’t forget
important stuff – they always say yes.
Use the ‘Getting To Know You’ questions checklist to take your notes – focus on them but of course, answer
any questions about you – then get back to them

Go to every 1-2-1 with a Specific Ask to a neighbor or vendor of the Paid Referral Source
Find a way to ask conversationally – Plan it!
Find a way to ask for introductions to any other leads that may come up during the conversation – not too
many but maybe one besides the Specific Ask you came into the meeting prepared to pursue.
“You mentioned JB Accounting a few minutes ago. That would be a great client for me. Can we figure out
how I can speak with them? I would love to set up another virtual lunch with them and you if you would like.”
“I would love to do the same thing with (neighbor or vendor Specific Ask you came prepared to ask about)”.

1) I guess the first one isn’t really a question – please just tell me about your business so I can get

2) Tell them you looked at their website and make a comment or ask some questions about that.

3) Do you have any specific target markets or a niche market?

These questions are interspersed with the business questions above and not asked rapid fire but rather, conversationally. Practice. And then practice. And then practice.

Paid Referral letter – Accountant

As part of our responsibility as your financial advisors, we are constantly researching methods to help you increase profitability in your business.
With that in mind, we have forged a relationship with a company called Schooley Mitchell. Their sole mandate
is to help their clients reduce business expenses for things like merchant services, small package shipping and
courier, waste, electronic logging devices, eSignature, fuel, facility supplies, less than truckload, software as a
service, uniforms and linens, unified communications as a service, compressed gases and telecommunications.
The best part of their service is that they don’t charge any fees to you unless they identify savings for you. They
don’t sell anything but are in fact independent and objective advisors just like we are in the field of accounting.
In other words, their fees are completely self-funded from money they find for you to put into your bank account. It is very likely that you are currently paying more to the various vendors than you should be paying and
Schooley Mitchell helps you fix just that.
We are very excited to build this relationship so that we can help you reduce your costs. We view this as a method of adding value to our relationship with you as your accountants. We are required to inform you by our CPA
Association that if they do find savings for you that we will receive a fee of 5% of those savings from Schooley
Mitchell. For three years you receive 50% of the savings you realize, Schooley Mitchell receives 45% of the
savings and we receive 5% of the savings. After three years you receive 100% of the savings. In a sense we are
helping you to pay for our own annual accounting fees and increase your profits every year.
If you decide to accept our recommendation to engage Schooley Mitchell to help reduce your costs, we will
help them to understand your expenditures. They will gather the appropriate records directly from you and – using their complex software tools, databases, and knowledge of the marketplace – will bring you recommendations on how to reduce costs after analyzing your specific usage patterns. You have the final say on whether you
want them to implement the recommendations, so you are always in control of the process.
I hope you accept this recommendation to have John Smith of Schooley Mitchell set up a short briefing with
you to show you how the process will work and to discuss whether or not he feels he can help you reduce your
operating costs.
Yours truly,

Hi Michael:
I know you are very busy so I want to help you as much as possible so you don’t have to spend much of your
valuable time, and yet you can benefit along with me in the referral process.
As I mentioned earlier today, I would send you a quick note to introduce me to John Jones over at Jones
Plumbing. I know that John will be pleased when we are able to help him increase his profits like we have with
our other happy referral clients.
Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need anything else from me.
Yours truly,
Joe
Email for your referral source to use to introduce you so they don’t have to draft it themselves.
Hi John:
I’ve been doing business with Joe Smith at Schooley Mitchell for the past little while and I thought you might
really benefit from an introduction.
Schooley Mitchell helps increase your profits by helping you to reduce your expenses. The best thing about
their service is they don’t charge any fees for their consulting services. Any fees they earn come out of the
found money they create for you through their professional analysis. They specialize in numerous areas such as
merchant services and waste, but they don’t sell you anything. They just help you reduce those expenses.
Anyway, I know that they have helped a number of businesses in your industry so I thought I would make the
introduction for you.
Joe told me he was going to give you a call so I thought I would let you know that I certainly recommend him to
help you, and there is no risk to let him see if he can find you some additional profit.
Please give me a call anytime if you want to discuss Joe or Schooley Mitchell.

Relationship Building Best Practices

The idea here is to call another business professional and explain that you are operating a professional business
and you feel that there may be some reciprocal value in getting to know each other. Invite them to lunch, or just
tell them that you will be in their area and would like to meet for coffee if you don’t want to spring for lunch or
dinner.
You can pick your own activity level with this strategy but if you want to fill your funnel significantly you could
do this four times a day for the next three months if you’re really serious about building your business to the
next level. These calls are easy to make because you are not asking for anything – just to determine ‘if we can
help each other’. If you make ten calls like this you will get at least half of them that will agree to meet with
you – for lunch, for coffee, or even in their office if that’s their desire.
So who do you call – the list is endless:
Accountant		
Banker			
Sales Coach		
Chamber Staff		
Economic Developers
BNI Member		
IT Consultants		
Association Manager
Business Trainers		
NFIB/CFIB

Lawyer				
Credit Union Manager		
Mentors – Business People
Investment Dealer		
City Center Committee		
Telecom Vendors			
Cost Reduction Consultants
Business Services			
Insurance Agency Manager

Financial Planner
Other Consultants
Chamber Manager
Receivers
Former Associates
Hardware Vendors
Computer Sales
Business Products
Community Leaders

Every one of these people is looking for help and looking for relationships and they don’t necessarily know
their best alternatives. The key here is to focus on them. Do a little research and then ask them intelligent
questions about their business, their needs, their pains, what they’re looking for, how you can help if possible,
what their personal interests are, etc.
There is no way that you will have that conversation without them asking for some more details about you and
Schooley Mitchell.
The key here is that there is no bad result regardless of what happens because you shouldn’t go in with any
expectations except to meet someone new, learn about their business, and inform them about yours. The whole
point here is that if you stay true to this program through regular meetings your business will flourish just
because more people know about you and our great business.

Relationship Building Best Practices

Cont.
The more people that you talk to – regardless of who they are – the better you will get at delivering your
message – and the more advocates you will build up.
If you expect a specific result, you could fail – if you don’t expect a specific result then it’s impossible to fail.
Remember:
1) Focus on them – ask about their business
2) Ask how you can help, if possible
3) Ask about their challenges, stresses, competition, shortfalls, strengths, interests,
opportunities, plans, etc.
4) Your goal is also to inform/spread the word about your business and as long as you
are able to do that you have succeeded
5) Also inform them that you are looking to grow and that you are looking for referrals –
your goal is informing (if they bite then you can discuss our referral programs but
if they don’t you’ve still met your goal)
6) When you go home determine if there is Distinctive Value (particularly information/books/
seminars/articles/websites etc. to address their needs/interests) you can provide to address any
of the subjects you discussed in #3 – including personal interest
The formula is simple – more relationships = more business. Stay true to the program and promise yourself to
set up two of these meetings every week for the next three months and you’ll be shocked at what will happen
(unless you’ve already got more appointments than you need!)

Tip Summary
If you want to make more money and you’re not working eight hours every day from Monday to Friday, then
commit to fill every open hour with one of these meetings. The more you practice at delivering your message,
the more advocates you will build up.

Open Twos – Open Threes – Open Groups

Open Twos – Open Threes – Open Groups
When you walk into a room, where do you start?

People standing perpendicular or in a closed circle can be bypassed – it is difficult to strike up a conversation
unless you have someone introducing you.
Focus on people standing in Open Twos, Open Threes and Open Groups – they stand askew making it easy
to slide in to start a conversation.
Teach this technique to your networking and service club members, it encourages conversation and makes
visitors feel more welcome.

Networking Questions

Five Networking Questions That Work Every Time
1) How'd you get started in your business?
People like to be the movie of the week. They will share their story while
you listen actively.
2) What significant changes have you seen take place over the years?
This is a great question. People love to tell the story of change.
3) What do you see for the future?
This is a spectacular question, which should provoke some insightful
comments about needs.
4) What makes your approach different?
Give them an opportunity to do a little bragging.
5) What's the best way to promote your business?
This accentuates the positive. You are not looking for secrets, merely
admiring business acumen and can probably open a two-way conversation
about business building.

BNI & Referral Groups

BNI – Referral Groups
• Join Business Network Intl. or a similar group (ie., LeTip, B2B Power Network, BNI, Firestorm, National
Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO), Canadian Association of Women Executives &
Entrepreneurs (CAWEE)

• Join only one group like this

• Mandate is to refer business

• Nothing wrong with joining a group like this and also a chamber-type group, and
a service club too depending on time availability

• If you join two referral – based groups, both will feel betrayed

• Just being a member accomplishes nothing – You must Net – Work!
• Attend regularly -- Commit
• Decide -- Follow our BNI Program

BNI First Meeting Script

BNI First Meeting Script
1)  We don’t sell anything.
2) W
  e don’t charge fees to our clients.
3)  I’m Dennis Schooley and my company is Schooley Mitchell
4)  We help clients reduce their costs in (slowly and use your fingers) Telecom, Merchant Services,
Small Package Shipping and Courier, Waste, Electronic Logging Devices, eSignature, Fuel,
Facility Supplies, Less than TruckLoad, Software as a Service, Uniforms and Linens, Unified
Communications as a Service, Compressed Gases.
5)  We only share in the savings we create for our clients – no savings, no fee.
6) W
  e have helped more than 24,000 clients and keep a database of all the pricing we have obtained
for them. That gives us a lot of clout and a lot of knowledge.

Yes, this is not too much but it is memorable. It is to the point. It should solicit conversation.
It will set up your next meeting – Robin Hood and the Envelope Presentation for your longer presentation.
(#2 is not technically true but it’s fine for a BNI presentation)

Specific Ask For Every BNI Meeting

Specific Ask For Every BNI Meeting
If you do this right it can be the source of many referrals for you
Stalk at least one member before the meeting (Know Your Members)

Go to every BNI meeting with a Specific Ask to a neighbor or vendor of a BNI Member
Be safe and go with two in case one member is not there (you decide whether you use just one or both)
When you mention the name of the Specific Ask ensure you are not staring at the person that you know is
familiar with the desired company. That seems contrived. Just mention the name of the target as an example
of a what “a good client would look like for me” and continue. Hopefully the person that knows that company
will bring that referral for you in the future.
Use this as your close your presentation each week – “And my featured prospect for this week is Jones
Plumbing.”
This tactic will not only make it easier for your fellow members to make referrals to you which is good for them
(it makes them look good), it also increases familiarity with what you are looking for if you do it meeting after
meeting.

BNI Members Referral Letter

BNI Members Referral Letter
Hi Bob.
I had a question at our last BNI meeting about the type of prospect that would make a perfect referral for me. It made
me realize that one of your neighbors close to your business would actually be a great referral for me. Do you know
anyone at Jones Plumbing?
If you are OK with making that referral to me, I would be more than happy to follow up. I’m pretty sure we will be
able to increase their profits with no risk to them.
Please let me know at the next meeting if you would be able to introduce me to someone of responsibility at Jones
Plumbing. Let’s talk about the best method of introduction to increase our chance of success as well.
Thanks Bob – much appreciated.
Yours truly,
Dennis Schooley

Memory Hooks

Memory Hooks
Memory description that will be remembered – gain attention when speaking
• “Do you know any businesses that would like to keep their money – they can
probably use our service.”
• “Our motto is that we can save money for anyone with more than two cell phones.”
• “We're the Robin Hoods of telecom. We steal money from the phone company
for our clients.”
• “Have you ever been mad at the courier company? We help get revenge!”
• Get five people to stand. Then tell one of them to sit down. “80% of companies – four out
of five – experience telephone billing errors according to a U.S. survey.”
• “Do you use the weigh and pay it method?‟ Most companies do when it comes to
bills – if it weighs the same as last month it's off to accounts payable.”
• “Does anybody know how many busy signals your customers got last year?”
• “Beam me up Scotty”. That's about the only thing from Star Trek that hasn't come
true in today's telecom market.”
• “I thought fiber came in cereal – now I talk over it!”

BNI Script – Flaming $100 Bill

BNI Script – Flaming $100 Bill
Learn the exact script.
Wave the $100 Bill

Do you know every business out there is burning up their money?
What I mean by that is everybody is paying more than they should for Telecom, Waste, Courier and other
expenses
That’s what we do at Schooley Mitchell – we put that fire out - we make sure none of our clients pay more
than they should

We all know that it’s sometimes difficult to find appropriate referrals for each other because people don’t
regularly change accountants, insurance agents, plumbers, or dentists, etc.
And yet we are all here to look out for each other – and we all build our businesses through referrals or we
wouldn’t be here.

I don’t want to sound too selfish here but at Schooley Mitchell our business is much easier than most because every business needs our help and nobody has a cost reduction consultant
AND – we don’t charge fees to do our audits

In order to make it easier for you to see who I am looking for as clients, please think about (and write it down
if you wish); one of 1) through 12) below

And my featured prospect for this week is Franklin Garrity Accounting.

(Note – only do one grouping per meeting)
1) T
  he businesses close to your business – to the north, south, east and west
2) T
  he vendors to your business – the people your business buys from
3) Y
  our personal vendors – who do you buy stuff from – who is your insurance agent, plumber, car
dealer, doctor, dentist, HVAC vendor, accountant, financial planner, banker, church, etc.

BNI Script – Flaming $100 Bill

4) Your relatives – parents, siblings, children, cousins – do they work in businesses?
5) The people you know in your neighborhood – do they work in businesses?
6) The people that you network with in other organizations – do they own businesses?
7) T
  he people you recreate with – golf, tennis, social groups, dinner groups, card groups, fishing buddies, similar personal interests
8) T
  he parents of the kids that play sports or activities with your kids or grand kids– do they work in
businesses
9) Y
  our customers or clients – can we be a value-add to them by saving them some money and increasing their profits?
10)  Do you know any professionals – accountants, lawyers, architects, engineers, doctors, dentists,
financial planners, stock brokers, bankers,
11)  Do you know any builders with several employees– carpenters, plumbers, HVAC, landscapers,
electricians, lumber yards, electrical or plumbing supplies,
12) Do you know any people that are involved in non-profits, charities, churches etc.

Hokey – If you feel this is hokey then claim hokey. Tell them you know “it’s hokey but Corporate asks us to do
this presentation because it does provide clarity. So here I go”. (Now it’s not your fault!)

Do this presentation at least 20 times per year – focusing on a different group each week. You can use all 12
groups or pick a few (4 to 6) and re-circulate them if you wish.

Decide. I want success at my BNI. I need to do what works.

Individual Meetings/Lunches with BNI Members

Individual Meetings/Lunches with BNI Members
Schedule 1-2-1 Lunches with every member at least twice per year
If you do this right it can be the source of many referrals for you
Start with the one most likely to refer to you and then the next
Stalk them before the meeting (Know Your Members)
Buy them lunch – even if it’s virtual – send them lunch with a food delivery service and break bread with them
virtually – a bit of fun makes for good connections
Prepare for the meeting – and tell them you want to take some notes as you go along so you don’t forget
important stuff – they always say yes
Use the ‘Getting To Know You’ questions checklist to take your notes – focus on them but of course, answer
any questions about you – then get back to them

Go to every 1-2-1 with a Specific Ask to a neighbor or vendor of the BNI Member
Find a way to ask conversationally – Plan it!
Find a way to ask for introductions to any other leads that may come up during the conversation – not too
many but maybe one besides the Specific Ask you came into the meeting prepared to pursue
“You mentioned JB Accounting a few minutes ago. That would be a great client for me. Can we figure out
how I can speak with them? I would love to set up another virtual lunch with them and you if you would like.”
“I would love to do the same thing with (neighbor or vendor Specific Ask you came prepared to ask about)”.

One of the things that we have found at Schooley Mitchell is that it is so much easier to refer to us
because everyone needs what we do, and we don’t charge money for our audits so lots of our people
reward our referral sources by sharing the fees. If you do refer to me, I would be glad to share the
wealth with you. I would love to pay you 10% of anything I receive from your referrals. One of my fellow
consultants paid $40,000 to one referral source recently so it can be significant.

Contact Spheres

Build the Contact Spheres To Increase Your Referral Sources
Collaborate for this one!
Identify 2 or 3 other members you would like to work with for this strategy.
1)  Allocate each BNI member to a Contact Sphere using the Schooley Mitchell Contact Sphere Forms.
2) I dentify missing Sphere members. Start with our own sphere – Professional and Business Services
		a. Accountant
		b. Lawyer
		c. Banker
		
d. Mortgage Broker
		
e. Commercial Real Estate
		
f. Commercial Insurance
		
g. Financial Planner
		
h. Stock Broker
		
i. Management Consultant
		
j. IT Company
		
k. Tax Consultant
		
l. Sales Coach
		
m. Training Consultant
		
n. NFIB/CFIB Sales
		
o. HR Consultant
		
p. Other Consultants
		q. Other
3)  Example - If there is no accountant in your group, ask your own accountant to join if appropriate.
4)  Otherwise, ask one of your collaborative members in a one-to-one discussion if they think their
accountant might be the right type for the group. It would be an accountant that might have several hundred small and medium business clients. Collaborate with the other member to discuss the
merits of the BNI with that accountant, or another one you identify together – hold the discussion
together if possible – even better over lunch. Seek out an accountant until you find one together.
5)  Communicate the vision of a vibrant, helpful, long-term, professional club. Communicate the vision
of what you can build together to benefit everyone. If you don’t believe it yourself, you will never
convince anyone (“How great could this be if…”)

6) D
  o this same thing (one-on-one discussions with one collaborator at a time – not with the whole
group at once) for a lawyer, financial planner, other consultants, etc. (don’t target the same type of
business with more than one collaborator)
7)  Establish these collaborative tactics with two or three BNI members to build the professional sphere
as priority No. 1 – one by one
8)  Once you complete the Professional Sphere do the same with each of the other spheres.
If you do this correctly, you will be a hero to the people you bring into the club, you will be a hero/friend with
the two or three member collaborators, and the club overall will see you as someone that is really committed
and helping. Your referrals will increase significantly.

Aquarium Experiment – The Value of Persistence
A plexiglass divider was placed in an aquarium with small edible fish on one side and predatory larger fish on
the other. The predators kept bumping their nose on the plexiglass trying to eat the smaller fish.
After several attempts, they gave up and stopped trying.
Once the plexiglass was removed, they still did not attempt to venture to the area of the appetizers.
It would have been a feast if persistence was applied.

Why Stories Work

Why Stories Work
Neuro-coupling – Two people’s brains sync with stories

Oxytocin – More is released with stories – creates empathy for story-teller (trust builds)

Stories affect the Amygdala – Emotional decision making

Decisions are not made on Data – they are made on emotion – start with the Amygdala

Stories
1) Build & release tension – where is it going?

2) Builds an idea (can leave you changed)

Stories should reinforce the data

The Briefing

Questioning Protocol

Questioning Protocol – Seek to understand ... then seek to be understood
We ask questions to get at beliefs so we can deal with real issues. Decisions are made based on beliefs. If we
can identify problems, then we can determine what thinking can help because problem solving must involve
different thinking than the thinking that caused the problem.
1. “Briefing to determine if I can help you”
2.  Important! Find out about the Company – how do they do business – what stresses are related to their job.
It is very important to ask general company questions first to show your interest and to show your understanding of their business. Only after you find out about the company do you ask directly about its communications, merchant services, small package shipping, waste, e-Signatures and electronic logging devices.
Of course, sometimes it can't be avoided because the client leads you there; however, don't give up on
asking questions about how they do business. It creates trust and enthusiasm.
3. Then find out how they communicate, get paid, courier goods and dispose of waste.
4.  Find out their stresses related to telecom, merchant services, small package shipping and courier, waste,
electronic logging devices, eSignature, fuel, facility supplies, less than truckload, software as a service,
uniforms and linens, unified communications as a service, compressed gases. In general, ask what they like
most about something so you can then ask what they like least (suppliers; services; performance etc.).
5. Show the benefits that we will deliver to them – “for you”
6. Ask about personal interests
7. Follow Up – Pulse, Personal DV

Objections

Welcome to our little friend

Welcome to our little friend
Objections are a buildup of:
1) Their past
2) Their history and experiences
3) Their assumptions
4) Their beliefs
5) What they have been taught
These things are what make them who they are today.
Their view of typical salespeople:
1) They don’t listen.
2) It’s all about them.
3) They don’t really care about me.
4) They’re disruptive.
5) They push you into things you don’t really want to do.
That’s quite a wall to climb.

Recognize Questions vs. Objections

How much does it cost?
I love this question – “Nothing up front, and nothing if we don’t find you savings, and a share of savings if we
put money back in your bank account.”

How many clients do you have?
27,000 and growing every week.

What does your service contract entail?
Our Service Agreement is pretty simple, it really just says five things.
1) You want me to do this.
2) You will provide me with the records I need to do this.

Recognize Questions vs. Objections

6 Tips for Success
1)	 Don’t be surprised. You are interrupting them. They very likely will give you an objection. Be ready for
it- expect it.
2) Breathe – they are in front of you, so you have time – use it.
3) Memorize your talk tracks – for all common objections.
4) Listen!!!! – Take the time to listen. You can listen better if you really know your talk tracks.
5)	 Be observant. Are they pre-occupied? Is it bad timing? Are they just being nice? Should you try them
later? What else could you use at a later briefing?
6) Build a relationship – we have all the tools to make multiple contacts and deliver multiple values.

Phone Objections – Different Techniques

Phone Objections – Different Techniques
You only have seconds on the phone.
There is no perfect response.
It’s a numbers game – linear relationship between # of conversations and successes.
You need to stick with a technique – master it before abandoning it.

Six Tips for Success Over the Phone
1) Don’t be surprised – you are interrupting them. They will probably give you an objection so be ready.
2) Print out your objection responses. Build a reference library.
3)	 Keep track of any new ones – and document them. Always be ready to learn more. Stick to the same
talk track and you will get new objections to document.
4) Be confident! Speak with authority.
5) Time is not your friend. You have seconds to respond.
6) Don’t sell over the phone. Not too much detail – that’s for the briefing.

50% is Too Much, 3 Years is Too Long
“Fifty percent for three years is too much. I'll do a one year deal or 35%.”
As with all objections:
1) O
  bjections are actually an opportunity for us – we can present more facts and strengths about our program
2) You always start off by addressing the objection with:
a) I'm glad you brought that up…
b) That's a good point…
c) I understand what you mean…
d) We have a lot of clients with the very same concern…
f) You never follow up a), b), c) or d) with "but…‟
The first thing to realize when someone puts this objection forward is that they are negotiating with you.
Therefore you should try to understand their motivation. You do this by asking why they feel that 3 years/50%
is a problem – AND THEN SHUT UP! Do not speak next until they have spoken to reveal their thoughts on
why it's a problem. They may reveal that it's the term that concerns them, or the percentage, or both, or they
just want to see if you'll negotiate. At least you will understand their concerns and you won't give away things
you don't have to give away. In addition you can address the objection from a proper perspective.
My responses in relation to this objection generally follow this pattern:
“Actually I'm glad you raised that issue because I can explain a little more clearly why our program is set up
this way.”
First of all, I would think that you'd want to write me the largest cheque (check) possible because that means
I've done the best job and the most work to bring you the most savings possible.
The reality is that we've invested millions and millions of dollars in developing our system to provide you the
maximum benefit and obviously we have to recover those investments. Those values are delivered directly to
you. In addition, we've spent over a decade developing our software tools, executing our research, educating
our specialists and developing our system, again to maximize your benefits of saved time, saved money and
security through correct decisions.
One of the most beneficial parts of our service for you is that we will be vigilant in continually optimizing your
position. This will not be a one-time “shoot and run” analysis. We continue to consult and review your system
every three months so you don't waste your resources – time or money.

In addition, we handle management of all implementations, which can be a huge time waster for you throughout the three-year period. Most of our clients find the time savings to be just as important as the money we
recover for them.
The program is designed not only to recover all of these costs and deliver these benefits but of course to
cover my profit as well. I think it's a fair profit for the benefits delivered and I really don't apologize for wanting
to earn a profit. However, the risk is all mine."
At this point you are in the strongest position possible. It's time to shut up again.
If they see your point of view, then you should attempt to sign the Service Agreement and continue your factfinding. If they continue to try to negotiate you should say; “Well, given what I just told you, what would you
want to be paid if it was you delivering the service and benefits?” Then, guess what – yep – shut up.
If their response is a reasonable one then you can move towards negotiating the Service Agreement.
You may want to offer to go to 35% with the proviso that it will be for 48 months. There is actually very little
difference in return to you but they likely won’t do the math. You also have the ability to position this as a continuing consulting assignment for an additional 12 months for them.

50% is Too Much, 3 Years is Too Long
Hopefully this helps with positioning so you can get most of your Service Agreements at three years/50%.
Certainly, it should help get the best terms possible if you get comfortable delivering this information to your
prospective clients.
In order to be ready for this objection, you must learn these points – you must practice them – over and over
until they become second nature.
1) Makes sense you would want to motivate me to find maximum savings for you
2) We keep delivering value to you for three years – regular reviews
3) Vigilant Optimization – Not a one-time analysis – Stay on top of market – for you
4) Pain – others let money slip out the window
5) You focus on your core business
6) Investment in software
7) Investment in R&D
8) Investment in education of specialists
9) We really only get 30% over five years
10) Risk is all mine – profit is fair for the work and risk – I don't apologize for that
11) 35% over 48 months is an acceptable alternative

1) First of all, by using the contingency model, we take all of the risk out of it for you. If we don’t find profits for
you, you simply get a free audit of your services.
2) We set up our fee this way to compensate for all the work we will do for you including regular audits and
reviews each quarter for the next three years. We stay on top of the market so you don’t have to spend that
time and yet you optimize your position at all times – not just once.
3) In reality, we don’t get 50%. We share for 36 months but after that you get all the savings as the dollars
continue for you beyond the 36 months. For example, we only get 30% over a five-year period (write it down
using $100 of savings)
4) Of course, we have a lot of costs for our audit specialists, our specialized software tools, and documenting
best-in-class pricing information, which have to be recovered in our pricing model
5) Overall, I’m motivated to make you as much profit as possible because the more you increase your bottom
line then the more I make as well – we certainly have unified goals
6) In addition, we handle management of all implementations which can be a huge time waster for you
throughout the three-year period. Most of our clients find the time savings to be just as important as the
money we recover for them.
Fall back position
I could consider reducing the percentage if you are OK with extending the term where I will work for you – let’s
say 48 months of audits and reviews and I will receive 35% of the savings. In return for reducing the percentage, how about you promise to give me a letter of recommendation if you’re happy with our work – which I
know you will be!

Contract with Vendor

Contract with Vendor
I just signed a three-year contract with AT&T, you won’t be able to help me.
As with all objections:
Objections are actually an opportunity for us – we can present more facts and strengths about our program
You always start off by addressing the objection with:
a) I’m glad you brought that up…
b) That's a good point…
c) I understand what you mean…
d) We have a lot of clients with the very same concern…
e) I know how you feel, we have a lot of clients that felt the same way, what we found…
(this is the feel, felt, found positioning)
f) You never follow up a), b), c) or d) with "but…‟
We have many other clients in that same situation. I’d still like to review that contract so I can understand
what you’re committed to and what you’re not. Sometimes you can still negotiate options with the supplier
as long as you don’t change suppliers. Sometimes, if your business is valuable, other suppliers may buy-out
the contract. In some cases, the contract isn’t as binding as you think and there is room for movement. Even
though there is a contract in place, there may still be some billing errors. If I can examine the contract and
bills to find out this information, and there is no room for movement, I’d still like to be able to be “in second
place‟ so to speak, so that you know that I'm there to help if you need help or if circumstances change.
There may be some things that we can help you with in other areas of your telecom as well.
In order to be ready for this objection, you must learn these points – you must practice them – over and over
until they become second nature.
1) Understand what you’re committed to…
2) Can still negotiate options sometimes if no supplier change
3) Other suppliers may buy out
4) Sometimes not as binding as you think
5) May be room for movement
6) May still be billing errors
7) Other areas of telecom not under contract
8) Second Place Strategy
a. Pulse
b. Send them something to address personal stress
c. Send them something (knowledge-based) to address business stress
d.Help them as if you were their actual supplier of consulting services – not with our
chargeable services but with anything else you can

Telecom Brokers
“We have a Telecom Broker – One-Stop-Telecom-Shop. I don't know how you can help us.”

As with all objections:
Objections are actually an opportunity for us – we can present more facts and strengths about our
program
You always start off by addressing the abjection with:
a) I'm glad you brought that up…
b) That's a good point…
c) I understand what you mean…
d) We have a lot of clients with the very same concern…
e) I know how you feel, we have a lot of clients that felt the same way, what we found…
(this is the feel, felt, found positioning)
f) You never follow up a), b), c) or d) with "but…‟
“Actually, I'm glad you mentioned that because we are often compared to Telecom Brokers that offer various products
and services from various suppliers. They often do a good job for their clientele, and they make their profit from commissions from the supplier of the products or services. We do similar comparisons, except we look at the entire market
place rather than just a specific set of suppliers. In addition, we don't get paid via commissions from the supplier, which
means that we have no reason to favor the one that's paying the most commissions over the other. Only the best package for you is what we recommend.
The most significant difference is that we are vigilant in optimizing you on a continuous basis. A Broker is not rewarded
for continuing to drive your prices and costs down as market opportunities become available because that simply cuts
into their own margins and profits. Once they make a sale to you it doesn't pay them to keep decreasing your costs.
However, we are constantly in your corner looking for better pricing, and better options that fit your business, and the
way that you communicate.
As we find better alternatives for you we are rewarded, which aligns our motives with yours. That's why our clients are so
happy with our services, because our goals are always consistent with yours.”
As with all objections, you must be prepared for them, and therefore you must practice (rehearse) the points that you
wish to bring into the conversations. In this case, memorize the three main points:
In order to be ready for this objection, you must learn these points – you must practice them – over and over until they

1) They get paid commissions and we don't
2) We look at all suppliers, not just those paying us commissions (the ones they represent)
3) We continue to optimize you, while that's contradictory to the Broker's interests

Schooley Mitchell is a Franchise

Schooley Mitchell is a Franchise – “I’m not sure if I want to deal with a Franchise.”
As with all objections:
Objections are actually an opportunity for us – we can present more facts and strengths
about our program
You always start off by addressing the objection with:
a) I’m glad you brought that up…
b) That’s a good point…

I’m glad you brought that up. Although it doesn’t seem like the normal method for delivering professional services, there are actually a lot of reasons that it works perfectly for Schooley Mitchell. It’s absolutely the best
way for us to execute our business.
Our business, our specialty, is cost reduction consulting. We’ve chosen Franchising as our penetration strategy because of the great strength it brings to our business. It allows us to have expertise within our company
in all telecom disciplines and technologies through the more than 200 people that are partnered through our
system. In fact we have several thousand cumulative years of telecom experience and knowledge throughout
our system.
Not only do we cover all of our clients’ technical needs through our network of experts, our system allows us
to provide coverage for any client no matter where their locations are throughout North America. The Franchising strategy has actually provided us with a tremendous strength that would never have been possible in
any other strategy. We certainly don’t apologize for having each of our Consultants with a stake in, and stewardship of, their own business, but also to have the luxury of the strength, and the access to such a tremendous wealth of knowledge and ability.
It allows us to have a centralized Research & Development department that not only provides us with a great
knowledge resource, but also gathers the experiences of all of our Consultants across North America, and
then makes that information available to all of us – instantaneously through our intranet.
It allows us to have a central resource of programmers that develop better and better analytical tools for us on
a continuous basis. It’s the only way we can stay on top of this volatile market efficiently for you. It also allows
us to develop extremely valuable training resources in a world that changes every day. It's the only way we
can stay current.
Most people think of hamburgers, submarine sandwiches, and muffler parts when they think of Franchising.
The reality is that 40% of restaurant and services are delivered through Franchises in North America – even
though only 3% of the companies are actually Franchises.

Schooley Mitchell is a Franchise
When you think about it, every State in the Union (Province in the Dominion) is a Franchise.
The biggest and most successful companies in North America operate through a system of
Franchising or distributorship so they can share resources. That's how GM, Ford, & Chrysler
do business.
Actually Price Waterhouse and KPMG are just like Franchises. Their local partners own the
local office, share resources, and share the name with all of the other offices. The only difference is that all
partners give up more of their local results, and share a little more in everyone else's results. I like our method
better, where I get the benefits of the system of sharing resources and knowledge, yet keep my own autonomy and profits.
The New York Yankees are a Franchise, so are the Chicago Bulls, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Dallas
Cowboys.
I could go on forever because of the pride I have in our system, and in our method of doing business. We
are always looking for the best people to join our system because every talented person that joins Schooley
Mitchell simply creates more resources, and more strength that I can deliver through my own business for
you.
In order to be ready for this objection, you must learn these points – you must practice them – over and over

1) Perfect system for Schooley Mitchell – (with pride and confidence)

“We had a Contingency based consultant look at our energy invoices in the past, and we had
a bad experience.”

As with all objections:
Objections are actually an opportunity for us – we can present more facts and strengths about
our program
You always start off by addressing the objection with:
a) I’m glad you brought that up…
b) That’s a good point…
c) I understand what you mean…
d) We have a lot of clients with the very same concern…
e) I know how you feel, we have a lot of clients that felt the same way, what we found…(this is the feel, felt, found positioning)
f) You never follow up a), b), c) or d) with “but…‟
“Yes, we’ve had a lot of our clients that have had similar experiences. The complaints that they generally lodged with us
were:
1) They took our bills, sent us a report, and we haven’t seen them in three years, yet they keep sending us bills
2) Any cost-cutting measures we instituted ourselves resulted in further payments to them even though they had nothing
to do with it
3) The billings keep coming but the benefits are hard to determine
At Schooley Mitchell our background is in the Professions, and we have set our business up in a
professional manner unlike the companies that have caused you the problems.
First of all, we only sign an agreement with you for three years so our billings don’t go on forever. Our agreement doesn't
have an automatic renewal feature like some Contingency Consultants have done
it in the past. However, more important than that, we review your situation every three months to keep bringing you better and better value. We continue to analyze the market for you to keep driving your
costs down, and to look for better alternatives for you. We don’t just show up once and then invoice
you continually.
Secondly, you approve all of our recommendations before anything is implemented, or anything is
billed to you.
We know that there are good consultants and bad consultants, and we’re very proud of the professional business we
have created for our clients. Many of our clients are so pleased with our services that they renew their agreements after
the three years so we can keep bringing them value.”
Points to rehearse:
1) Three years only
2) No automatic renewals
3) We continue to provide service – vigilant optimization
4) You approve our recommendations before they are implemented
5) We bill only for our recommendations that you accept

 SCHOOLEY MITCHELL
MARKETING MANUAL

Implementation

Implementation of Your Recommendations

Implementation of Your Recommendations
1) ALWAYS make sure you build the relationship properly right from the beginning stages. A hit-and-run sale,
where the only emphasis is on ‘free, free, free’ will result in poor relationships and a higher likelihood that the
client will not implement your recommendations when you
present the Value Report.
2) Continue asking questions in the briefing until you are comfortable that the client has fully informed you and
fully understands what you will be doing for them. Ensure they understand your expectations in terms of what
you will identify on their behalf (three things – one, you will examine their invoices and contracts for errors,
two, you will identify redundant services – items they may not know they have, never use, and continue to pay
for, and three, you will examine marketplace alternatives and best-in-class pricing in every service category).
3) Never overpromise a quick turnaround. Make them realize that there is a lot of effort (and therefore value) in
doing what you do including research, benchmarking software tools, databases, understanding best-in-class
pricing and alternatives, negotiation, etc. If you’re presenting a report for $10,000, or $20,000 or more in annual savings and you return that to them in 10 days they are not going to understand the value that you are
delivering. Just don’t over promise in the first place and then their expectations are not out of whack with your
timing.
4) If you don’t have all of your questions answered and your time is up – set another briefing to find out.
5) Use the relationship tools – ALWAYS! That means sending a Welcome Letter every time – enroll them on
Pulse (use the explanation sample in the Marketing Manual), send a hand written note card, and send them
Distinctive Value items – articles, books, goods, gifts, ideas.
6) Always implement the SMARRT Relationship Builder Program right from the point of signing the Service
Agreement. Add value to the relationships long before you ask for something from them.
7) When you call for the appointment to present the Value Report emphasize how pleased you are with the results of your analysis. Tell them how you are really looking forward to showing them the reports because you
know they will be pleased as well! Make them feel your excitement without sounding phony.
8) Whenever you get ‘pushed down’ from an executive/financial person to an IT/Telecom/Tech person, ALWAYS ask for approval right then to come back with your findings to the executive “once you are done doing all of your work with the tech person” (“because my findings will generally have a positive impact on your
company’s bottom line so I will just need a couple of minutes of your time to SHOW you what I have found
for you”). They will generally say yes if you ask properly and then you won’t be in the position where you have
to break back through a resistant barrier to get your recommendations implemented. Ensure that the tech
person is part of the presentation and give them all the credit for working with you behind the scenes to help
get to the ‘value’.

 SCHOOLEY MITCHELL
MARKETING MANUAL

Implementation

Implementation of Your Recommendations

Implementation of Your Recommendations (continued)
If the tech person knows you will be going back to the executive and that you are going to make them the
hero, you’ll get more buy-in during the process as well as a higher likelihood of implementation.
9) ALWAYS present alternatives (three) in your Value Report – never just one solution.
10) ALWAYS present a three-year table for a two-year Service Agreement or a five-year table for a 3-year deal
– emphasizing that they reap the lion’s share of the benefit.
11) ALWAYS be prepared when you go into the meeting. Take completed vendor agreements and paperwork
for the recommendation you are summarizing in your Executive Summary. Not for all three (or more) alternatives. You can get that completed later if they choose a different alternative. You never sign the paperwork but
you can certainly prepare it to make it an easy transition for your client.
12) Present in detail for someone that wants detail and in summary fashion for someone that wants to get to
brass tacks. If you’re not sure which way to go – ask them. Would you like to go into detail in the three main
areas of the report (Current Configuration, Alternative Proposals, & Summary of Results) or review the Executive Summary of our findings?
13) NEVER just take a summary of your findings. The client will implement more readily and understand the
value you are delivering if your reports are complete and comprehensive. If the detail cannot be provided by
you then you have not completed the job properly and they will recognize that. Even if you are not reviewing
the detail with the client it is absolutely necessary to include it in the reports. You never know who will be seeing the report and if it’s incomplete or if shortcuts are taken they may not implement and you will ever know
why. There are no shortcuts to what we do.
14) Present the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative in your report which requires you to be prepared for that conversation.
15) Use the Best of Three language – all three make sense to me, which one makes most sense to you? That
way they don’t feel they have to say yes or no – right now. There are choices and they can set their own satisfaction level.
16) Don’t be afraid to ask for their approval to ‘move ahead and start saving you some money so you’re not
overpaying your vendors again next month’ – by initialing the Executive Summary. However, this shouldn’t
be a pressure sale at this point. There may be several reasons they have to review your findings. However, if
that’s the case, make sure you close the impending event – that you schedule an appointment with exact date
and time, to come back and discuss the implementation of your results.
17) Present segmented recommendations whenever you have one category completed before the others. This
allows you to test their willingness to implement so you don’t continue working on their behalf if they are not
going to do so. It also gets you to cashflow quicker instead of waiting until all categories are completed.
Employ all of these practises and you will implement a much higher percentage of your findings!

Steps & Commitments
Building Your Franchise

Steps & Commitments to Building Your Franchise
Action Items
1) Commit to obtain 60% of the businesses listed on your Community Vendors Checklist (Marketing Manual)
as clients within the first year of starting your Franchise. No exceptions, no excuses – this is the key to long
term success. Ask each client obtained for a referral to one of their vendors or a neighboring business and
now you have achieved an exponential growth pattern.
2) Ask five people you respect in business to review your Business Plan and ask them for input and
suggestions. Even if they don’t take the time to do it they will be flattered that you asked and they may
become advocates for you. At a minimum you will have informed 5 important business people about your
Schooley Mitchell Franchise.
3) Send out 100 ‘My New Business Letters’ or ‘My Great Business Letters’. This is not a solicitation letter but
rather just an information letter and a claim of pride in your business. If you are not a brand new Franchisee
then customize the “My New Business Letter’ in The Warehouse to send to friends, neighbors & relatives
based for your ‘first year (or fourth year) in business’. Informing people that you are happy and proud can only
bring you value in the long run and build your personal brand.
4) Commit to telemarketing. If you set a budget each and every month for one of the third party telemarketing
companies it will result in positive financial return as demonstrated by the significant results obtained by
existing Franchisees that have executed these programs.
5) Commit to a ‘Lunch Program’ where you take a client to lunch every month and also a Center of Influence
to lunch every month. This program will cost you $60 - $80 per month (less than $1,000 per year). If you
have 24 business lunches in a year you should definitely generate more than $1,000 in revenue so this is an
investment and not a cost.
6) Identify two Associations in your community where you can build a relationship and obtain a
recommendation to the membership. Commit to helping those Associations by providing our service to the
Association, providing ‘I’m An Expert’ articles to them on a regular basis (one article won’t cut it), speaking at
their events, attending their trade shows etc. Pay the Association a referral fee for any members that use your
services.
7) Join a networking club – a group that exists to refer clients to each other. Participate fully and
enthusiastically. Demonstrate your belief in the value and success of the club – and make it happen. Bring
in new members to the club if the membership is not what you think is optimum. Commit to taking each
member of the club to lunch within a year with the sole purpose of talking to them (interviewing them) about
their business and how you can help them – and how you can identify referrals for them
8) Establish at least one paid referral source (client, contact, Center of Influence, sales person, all of them?).
Write checks (cheques) to these people as quickly and as often as you possibly can

Steps & Commitments

9) Establish a paid referral relationship with a Chamber of Commerce in your area. Not all will participate but
some will – if not a Chamber, some other group that influences members.
10) Arrange to do at least one seminar or lunch-and-learn for a client every six months. Researching a topic of
interest to them and their staff will take a couple of hours of work and can create significant goodwill. This can
be done for groups of clients as well if you feel comfortable doing so.
11) Arrange to do a joint seminar with other Centers of Influence.
12) Offer our service for free to an Accounting firm (not too small and not too big) with the sole purpose of
obtaining a testimonial letter and a referral (or more)
13) Select one vertical market and commit to using the Vertical Market Attack checklist over the next year to
go deep and wide in that vertical.
14) Commit to obtaining one new client every week – no excuses – no matter how small that
client is it will build your business. As part of this strategy, you must commit to setting four or five
appointments every week and don’t stop doing what you need to do until that goal is achieved.
15) Commit to meeting two other business professional for coffee (or visit their office) every week. Review the
role play video in the distance learning area of the warehouse (Sales & Marketing)

Commitments to Success
16) Commit to using the Schooley Mitchell CRM program – every client. That includes a Welcome Letter, the
Pulse, the SMARRT Relationship Builder, handwritten note cards, and sending the client Distinctive Value
items (personal and business related). Not only will this help create a much better and deeper relationship
that delivers value to your client, it will also increase referrals and establish your claim as a professional that
not only provides a service but also helps your clients succeed. Using these relationship strategies will also
significantly enhance the likelihood of renewal with your clients at contract-expiry time.
17) Commit to adding a minimum of three people to The Pulse every week. The discussions you will have to
make this happen will be invaluable to your Franchise and the ongoing benefit of the ‘drip’ campaign cannot
be overestimated – both with clients and contacts.
18) Learn the elevator speeches cold so you can deliver your best 30 seconds at any time. You must know the
basic optimization/contingency message cold as well as the messages related to an IT/Telecom techie that
may get thrown in front of you at any time.
19) Learn the Lettuce Story so you can present it when time is an issue. Learn the Envelope Presentation that
demonstrates our program, our value, and our lack of risk for our clients.

20) Commit to sending out a minimum of three handwritten note cards each week. Make note of people you
meet, people receiving awards or promotions, instructors, thank people, acknowledge people, congratulate
people – there are a million reasons to send these cards.
21) Commit to building your database of personal interests and business interests of clients and other
contacts so you can be prepared to send distinctive value to them or inform them of something that fits their
interests.
22) Commit to ask every client for a testimonial letter and for a referral to a specific business – one of their
vendors or one of their neighbors.
23) Review the information related to the objection that 50% is too much until you know it cold.
24) Present segmented recommendations whenever you can to move up the timing of cashflow and also to
test the commitment to implementation of the client.
25) Present a five-year savings table every time (or a three-year table if you have signed a two-year Service
Agreement)
26) Commit to one hour per month to update, categorize – and strategize – related to your
contact & prospect list.
27) Commit to re-reading the Marketing Manual once per quarter.

Goal Setting
SMART Goals

SMART Goals
Following the SMART model when setting goals minimizes misunderstanding about expectations and makes
sure everyone has a clear expectation of what is expected and when.
SMART goals are:
SPECIFIC – A clear and unambiguous statement of what’s required
MEASURABLE – In tangible and readily understandable terms (quality, quantity, time,
and cost)
ATTAINABLE – While stretch goals are fine, bear in mind your capabilities and don’t try to do
more than you can—especially when you are just starting out
RELEVANT – To you, your business, and to the Schooley Mitchell mission
TIME BOUND – Avoid vague timeframes and pin it down to when X will be completed
Here are examples of three realistic goals for the first 30-90 days of business. Notice that all
three are specific, targeted goals:
• Set two appointments with new prospects per day
• Bring on 15 new clients within the first 90 days
• Identify three referral agents and build relationships with each of them by discussing mutually beneficial
activities and goals within the first 90 days (one per month)

Bibliography
I have had several Franchisees ask me for a list of books that I have read. I have provided a bibliography of
some of those books for everyone.
I have not included the standard fare of authors like Covey, Goleman, Pink, Collins, Hill, & Ziglar, etc. I have
read them too but most of you know them (or should know them). They have all written great books that
are widely reviewed and discussed. However, I have listed books that are not necessarily the standard fare
although I’m sure you have heard of some of them, and have maybe read them. Some of them are quite old
with a few outdated ideas but still carry valuable messages. Some of them are brand new.
As you know, I preach with conviction that everyone should read at least one business book each month.
There are several reasons for this conviction:
1) It helps you to be interesting and to add value to networking conversations

I haven’t really put the books in order of preference or value. However, I will say that I have read the first ten
books listed multiple times in order to really understand them and use the great info provided. I will also say
that if nothing else make it a contract with yourself to read the first ten books listed within a year and you will
be a smarter, more profitable, and more effective person – period.
Here’s a profound thought for you – read and re-read and learn the ones marked in yellow and you will
change your life! For the better by a mile.
So instead of turning on the TV at night... (The Real Housewives of Atlanta isn’t really that mind-expanding –
and it sure doesn’t make you any money).

 SCHOOLEY MITCHELL
MARKETING MANUAL

Bibliography
I will concede that some of the books have to be taken in the right light. For example the Susan Roane book
is hokey and full of self-compliments, and is actually maddening in some spots.
However, at the end of the book I did acknowledge that she made some great practical points that should
be followed even though they seem so simple. I Moved Your Cheese contradicts Who Moved My Cheese –
puzzling! Some are difficult like The World is Flat and Inside the Tornado. Mind Power has some ‘out there’
thoughts.
Sometimes Malcolm Gladwell can be frustrating because it seems there are never clear conclusions. He is a
great author with really great insights. However, he is also frustrating. You read his statements and positions
on one page and you go - oh yeah, yeah...and then the next page he proves the opposite and you go – oh,
damn!
At the end of the book Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, it was clear that the social media strategies that he
discussed were really not for our business for the most part but it was still interesting.
In addition, there are lots of books on the topics of hard selling skills such as prospecting, target marketing,
setting meeting (briefing) expectations, meeting with the right person, time management, negotiation, cold
calling, etc. but I have not included those books on my list. Everyone should read those books as well.
Google the topics – read the books - they will make you money.
One of the books quotes coaching great, John Wooden as follows; “Once you’re done learning, you’re done.”
Anyway, I hope some of you use this bibliography to increase your own knowledge and broaden your
business and interpersonal skills. As I said, it will make you more money.
